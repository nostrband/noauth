Noauth - Nostr key manager
--------------------------

THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE, DON'T USE WITH REAL KEYS!

This is a web-based nostr signer app, it uses nip46 signer
running inside a service worker, if SW is not running -
a noauthd server sends a push message and wakes SW up. Also,
keys can be saved to server and fetched later in an end-to-end
encrypted way. Keys are encrypted with user-defined password, 
a good key derivation function is used to resist brute force.

This app works in Chrome on desktop and Android out of the box,
try it with snort.social (use bunker:/... string as 'login string').

On iOS web push notifications are still experimental, eventually
it will work on iOS out of the box too.

It works across devices, but that's unreliable, especially if
signer is on mobile - if smartphone is locked then service worker might
not wake up. Thanks to cloud sync/recovery of keys users can import 
their keys into this app on every device and then it works well.
